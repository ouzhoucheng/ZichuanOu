# TI cup: Contactless temperature measurement & identification device

- **abstract:** The device can measure temperature, give a warn, record and recognize identification and detect mask wearing.
- **position:** Team member 
  1. I used C to develop stm32f4 MCU, read the value from Infrared temperature sensor and display it.
  2. I designed the mechanical structure, electricity layout, and assembled them into a whole.
- **award:** 2nd Prize in Tianjin, TI Cup National Undergraduate Electronics Design Contest

# Smart car - AI vision track

- **adstract:** The car can run for more than 2 mins; it can identify images and complete some actions; it can run 2 laps around the track, identify Numbers, Apriltags, images and complete the identification, targeting, etc.
- **position:** Team leader 
  1. I designed the scheme and mechanical structure, used SW to designed 3D connections, and assembled the whole system. 
  2. I used C to develop RT1064 MCU, read gray images from camera, used OTSU to get binary image, detect the features of track elements and planned the pathsã€‚ 
  3. I used AD to design the PCBs and completed all the welding.
- **award:** 1st Prize in national finals, The National University Students intelligent Car Race

# TI cup: Intelligent drug delivery car video code Nov. 2021

- **abstract:** The drug delivery car can recognize numbers, patrol the line, delivery the drug, return and work with another car.
- **position:**Team leader 
  1. I designed the scheme, mechanical structure and assembled the whole system. 
  2. I used C to developed RT1064 MCU, read RGB images, extract read line and planned the paths; I designed a state machine to control the car.
